We load historical traffic data from a CSV file.
We preprocess the data (not shown in detail here).
We split the data into training and testing sets.
We train a machine learning model (Random Forest Regressor) on the training data.
We evaluate the model's performance using Mean Squared Error on the testing data.
Finally, we would use the trained model to make predictions on real-time traffic data for traffic prediction.
